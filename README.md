===============================

This game is based on the Udacity Nano Degree arcade game.  The grading rubric is located here. https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

To run this game, open index.html in Chrome.

Upon start, the player will be presented with a game board displaying a grassy field, a street, and stream.  The player will also find a character ready for command!  To play the game, use the arrows (up, down, left, right) to move the player from the bottom of the screen to the top.  Upon reaching the top, the character will flash, demonstrating a level win.  Avoid the enemies - contact with one resets the level.

The player may collect gems and keys during the travels to increase the game score!

As play progresses through the levels, new characters are presented for play, more gems are provided for collection, and faster bugs in greater swarms increase the game play challenge!

Have fun!
